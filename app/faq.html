              <dt>What is (the goal of) RxFiddle?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>RxFiddle has multiple goals:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Aid developers in understanding reactive code</li>
                  <li>Aid new developers to learn the reactive paradigm</li>
                  <li>Aid developers finding bugs in reactive code</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The common goal here is to help developers. Whether you are building something yourself, viewing some code
                  of a collegue or learning Rx. Make doing Reactive Programming easier than ever. I wanted to do something
                  back after Rx gave me such a powerfull development tool.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt id="rxversion">Why go for RxJS version 4.1</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Rx is available in many flavors. I investigated whether it is possible to instrument RxJava and RxJs and
                  found out both the JVM and JavaScript libraries are perfectly instrumentable. Considering the visualization
                  tool is browser based the development cycle could be sped up by using a in-browser instrumented version
                  of Rx.</p>
                <p>Using RxJS 4.1 is mainly an effect of what I had available when I started of with extending RxMarbles. Creating
                  instumentation for RxJS 5 should be possible too but I expect some more work because of the new ecmascript
                  module structure of version 5.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt id="difficulties">It isn't that hard right?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Actually, it is. During the last year I found out just how complicated instrumentation, call stacks and visualization
                  are. Instrumenting Javascript is relatively easy - you just swap the prototype - but you do need a lot
                  of bookkeeping to relate all the gathered information to Observables, Observers and the events flowing
                  through. If you have got the basic map and filter operators working you are still far from done: throw
                  Subjects into the mix and your whole world turns upside down. Same for higher order streams and merging
                  them.
                </p>
                <p> And you can't just be lazy and correct stuff once you have more information. We are talking Rx here so I
                  wanted everything to be streamed, push based. Any intermediate debug state should be a valid state itself.
                </p>

              <dt id="thesismotivation">Why do a thesis on Reactive Programming / ReactiveX?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>I first used Rx.NET in 2013 while doing the last project as an undergraduate student. I remember that it
                  took me quite some time to fully understand the concepts of reactive programming. I did not really see
                  how the data would flow through the stream unless I sprinkled println statements through the stream. When
                  I first used the debugger to step through that code I thought about how awesome it would be to have better
                  tooling. Fast forward to 2015 and I'm laying out the plan for the rest of my master, and there is Erik
                  Meijer - inventor of Rx - as a professor at my university (TU Delft, The Netherlands).</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>Why did you setup the survey this way?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>The goal of the survey is to measure the difference between developing reactive programs using traditional
                  methodology and the development flow where the developer has the option to use RxFidle's capabilities.
                  I hope to speed-up and improve the comprehension of reactive code. The hypothesis is that using RxFiddle
                  the developer gains a better understanding of the reactive code and does so quicker.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>This looks like... (RxMarbles, RxVision, etc.)</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Yes! I got a lot of external inspiration. Andre Stalz has done some amazing work creating RxMarbles. I've
                  spend some time trying to evaluate whether I could just work with that and extend it, however RxMarbles
                  is mostly built around pre-specified examples, usable in for example the ReactiveX documentation, while
                  RxFiddle aims to visualize áll your reactive code and operators. No matter how crazy you get.</p>
                <p>RxVision is doing something comparable to what RxFiddle is doing. It instruments the Rx prototype and plots
                  a visualization. I found it to be limited however. The implementation lacks support for many very common
                  operators and its visualization is very unclear to people who have never seen the tool. It does not really
                  relate to marble diagrams like I feel RxFiddle does.</p>
