  abstract = {Wepropose a novel, comonadic approach to dataﬂow (stream-
based) computation. This is based on the observation that both general
and causal stream functions can be characterized as coKleisli arrows of
comonads and on the intuition that comonads in general must be a good
means to structure context-dependent computation. In particular, we de-
velop a generic comonadic interpreter of languages for context-dependent
computation and instantiate it for stream-based computation. We also
discuss distributive laws of a comonad over a monad as a means to struc-
ture combinations of eﬀectful and context-dependent computation.
We apply the latter to analyse clocked dataﬂow (partial stream based)
computation.},
